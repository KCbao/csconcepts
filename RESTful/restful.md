## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
XML is a tool to store and transport data. e.g., 
```
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```
The XML above is quite self-descriptive:

- It has sender information.
- It has receiver information
- It has a heading
- It has a message body.

ML and HTML were designed with different goals:

- XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
- HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
- XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are
