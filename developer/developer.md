## RAM vs Hard disk space
- hard disk/hard drive: disk space=how much space avaibale on your hard disk for storing files. When save a document or install new program, it gets stored on your hard disk
- memory/RAM: uses RAM to store actively running programs, including operating system. e.g., when computer boots up, os's interface and other processes get loaded into memory. When you open MS word, it gets loaded into computer's memory (RAM), when you quit the program, the memory is freed up. 

If want to load small amounts of data from hard disk space into system memory at one time, computers typically have much more hard disk space than memory. 

If your computer says that is not enough memory to run a certain program, you will need to upgrade your memory by buying more RAM.
